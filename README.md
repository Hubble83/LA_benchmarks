# LA_benchmarks

This repository contains the necessary scripts to recreate all the benchmarks presented in the paper.

It was not designed to work in every system. Please use it as a guide if any of the called scripts does not work properly.

Please edit predefined variables in the top of the *test_all.sh* script to fit the ones in your system.

Since the installation, configuration, and test take several hours, we advise testing a simple dataset first.
